Hey! Thanks for downloading my map.
If you see this you probably own a server, and since this is an interior, I will put some TP coordonates here so you don't have to search for them.
Keep in mind these are just my suggestions, you can always change them without breaking anything in the interior.

Outside the Interior Door - x = 503.5746, y = -1397.871, z = 4.6824
Inside the Interior Door - x = 509.7827, y = -1411.141, z = 29.3172

If you have a resource like esx_doorlock that locks doors here is some things you may want to know:

The first door (where you enter in the back) = apa_p_mp_yacht_door_02 ( x = 508.0482, y = -1399.738, z = 29.4974 )
The door to the sofa's and TV's = apa_p_mp_yacht_door_02 ( x = 511.1564, y = -1394.741, z = 29.4606 )
The Bedroom Door = apa_p_mp_door_mpa2_fant ( x = 496.9332, y = -1388.395, z = 29.4501 )
The Weed, Cocaine and guns lab = vw_prop_vw_casino_door_d1c ( x = 496.8938, y = -1365.727, z = 29.4605 )
The Beer Room = vw_prop_vw_casino_door_d1c ( x = 506.7134, y = -1365.727, z = 29.4605 )
